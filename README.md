1) Collection of data - Given
2) Data Cleaning/Feature Engineering - Try nothing, grayscale, and noise introduction of pixels, Draw bounding box?, Need to encode
3) Model building - CNN
4) Evalute Model - Should have target value
5) Model Deployment - Submission

Data Splitting: Cross-fold stratification (especially with small amount of data)

Preprocessing Ideas:

Labels image into a csv

Make images into GrayScale


Task Splitting:

Script for Grayscale

Python file with general idea of CNN
